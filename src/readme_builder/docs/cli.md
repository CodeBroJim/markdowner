## Markdowner CLI

Markdowner is a Python package that can be used to automate the creation of your project's README.md using individual module level markdown files.

This is helpful for when your project has modules with their own .md doc files and encourages singleton principles. Docs should live where they serve and should be maintained separately. Markdowner helps make that process more streamlined and automated.
